# Binary Tree Sort

Also quite basic one, in my opinion.

The thought is that, we can use a rule to create a Binary Search Tree first \-\- put smaller things left and larger things right. 

After that, we just use a in-order traversal run through them, and we'll get a sorted sequence.

Note: In-order traversal reads a tree in "left sub-tree -> center node -> right sub-tree" way, therefore, smaller one print first.
