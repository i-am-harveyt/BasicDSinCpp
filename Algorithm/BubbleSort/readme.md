### Bubble Sort

Another basic algorithm, while I  personally think it is not as intuitive as [Selection Sort](#selection_sort).

The thought is that, if there are two nearby elements, are not sorted, then swap them to make them sorted. Repeatedly check all elements in the array until they're all sorted.
