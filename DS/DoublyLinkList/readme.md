# Doubly Linked List

Structure:

```
+------+-----+------+
| prev | val | next |
+------+-----+------+
```

Differs from Singly link list, we store two pointers that respectively points to previous and next node.

Therefore, we can access previous and next node as we want.

Though it makes access convenient, however, it also sometimes make maintainance of pointers not very intuitive.
