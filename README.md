# BasicDSinCpp

## Intro
Basic Data Structure in C++, try to practice my C++ programming skill and implement those I've learned.

Maybe one day I'll update the content in README, but I'll put more emphasis on writing code instead.

### Currently uploaded

## Table of Content

1. [Stack](##Stack)

2. Queue
    1. [Array](##QueueInArray)
    2. [Linked List](##QueueInLL)

3. [BinaryTree with Pre/In/Post-order traversal](##BTTraversals)

4. [XOR Linked List](##XORLL)


<a name="Stack"></a>
## Stack

Implement Stack using Array. Also implemented push, pop, isEmpty, isFull functions.

<a name="QueueInArray"></a>
## Queue implemented by Array

Implement Queue using Array. Also implemented enqueue and dequeue functions. The emptiness and fullness of queue will be notified when calling these functions.

<a name="QueueInLL"></a>
## Queue implemented by Linked List

The introduction is almost as same as [Queue implemented by Array](#QueueInArray)

<a name="BTTraversals"></a>
## BinaryTree with Pre/In/Post-order traversal

Implement BT, using Linked List, and three traversals. The tree will be created automatically and \(maybe\) randomly.

<a name="XORLL"></a>
## XOR Linked List

Implement XOR Linked List, I like this Data Structure persoanlly, 'cause I think this is a great use of XOR.
